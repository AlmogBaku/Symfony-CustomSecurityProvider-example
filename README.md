================================================

1. This project is an example of how to deploy a symfony2 Project with:
  - FOSRestBundle

  - OAuth2 Server (via FOSOAuthServerBundle)
  - Building a REST API with the above

Our provider simply allowing you to authenticate using BASIC HTTP AUTH with your exists client_id and secret of the
OAuth2 Client as user and password!
